# fundamental ML Algos in C++

Repo designed to exemplify the how machine learning algorithms are implemented under the hood and how faster algorithms run under C++ compared to R.

i.e. *this is how your imported library packages are implemented under the hood.*

### Algorithms
- logistical regression
- gaussian naive bayes
